# Note: FastAPI applications require a server runtime
# This configuration is for reference only

  # Netlify is for static sites and serverless functions
  # For FastAPI deployment, use:
  # - Heroku
  # - Railway
  # - Render
  # - AWS Lambda (with Mangum adapter)
  # - Google Cloud Run
  # - Azure App Service
  # - DigitalOcean App Platform
